            <h3>Imagine - John Lennon</h3><br>
                    Imagine there's no heaven<br>
                    It's easy if you try<br>
                    No hell below us<br>
                    Above us only sky<br><br>
                    
                    Imagine all the people<br>
                    Living for today<br>
                    Living for today<br><br>
                    
                    Imagine there's no countries<br>
                    It isn't hard to do<br>
                    Nothing to kill or die for<br>
                    And no religion too<br><br>
                    
                    Imagine all the people<br>
                    Living life in peace<br>
                    You may say, I'm a dreamer<br>
                    But I'm not the only one<br>
                    I hope someday you'll join us<br>
                    And the world will be as one<br><br>

                    Imagine no possessions<br>
                    I wonder if you can<br>
                    No need for greed or hunger<br>
                    A Brotherhood of man<br><br>

                    Imagine all the people<br>
                    Sharing all the world<br><br>

                    You may say, I'm a dreamer<br>
                    But I'm not the only one<br>
                    I hope someday you'll join us<br>
                    And the world will live as one<br>

            <br><h3>What a Wonderful World - Louis Armstrong </h3><br>
            I see trees of green, red roses too<br>
            I see them bloom for me and you<br>
            And I think to myself, what a wonderful world<br>
            I see skies of blue and clouds of white<br>
            The bright blessed days, the dark sacred night<br>
            And I think to myself, what a wonderful world<br>
            The colors of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky<br>
            Are also on the faces of people going by<br><br>
            I see friends shaking hands, saying: How do you do?<br>
            They're really saying: I love you!<br>
            I hear babies crying, I watch them grow<br>
            They'll learn much more, than I'll never know<br>
            And I think to myself, what a wonderful world<br>
            Yes, I think to myself, what a wonderful world<br>

            <br><h3>The Sound Of Silence - Simon & Garfunkel</h3><br>
            Hello darkness, my old friend, <br>
            I've come to talk with you again, <br>
            Because a vision softly creeping, <br>
            Left its seeds while I was sleeping,<br>
            And the vision that was planted in my brain<br>
            Still remains<br>
            Within the sound of silence.<br><br>

            In restless dreams I walked alone<br>
            Narrow streets of cobblestone,<br>
            'Neath the halo of a street lamp,<br>
            I turned my collar to the cold and damp<br>
            When my eyes were stabbed<br>
            by the flash of a neon light<br>
            That split the night<br>
            And touched the sound of silence.<br><br>

            And in the naked light I saw<br>
            Ten thousand people, maybe more.<br>
            People talking without speaking,<br>
            People hearing without listening,<br>
            People writing songs<br>
            that voices never share<br>
            And no one dared<br>
            Disturb the sound of silence.<br><br>

            "Fools" said I, "You do not know<br>
            Silence like a cancer grows.<br>
            Hear my words that I might teach you,<br>
            Take my arms that I might reach you."<br>
            But my words like silent raindrops fell,<br>
            And echoed<br>
            In the wells of silence<br><br>

            And the people bowed and prayed<br>
            To the neon god they made.<br><br>
            And the sign flashed out its warning,<br>
            In the words that it was forming.<br>
            And the sign said,<br>
            "The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls<br>
            And tenement halls."<br>
            And whisper'd in the sounds of silence<br>

            <br><h3>We Are The Champions - Queen </h3><br>
            I've paid my dues <br>
            Time after time<br>
            I've done my sentence<br>
            But committed no crime<br>
            And bad mistakes<br>
            I've made a few<br>
            I've had my share of sand kicked in my face<br>
            But I've come through<br>
            And we mean to go on and on and on and on<br>
            We are the champions, my friends<br>
            And we'll keep on fighting till the end<br>
            We are the champions<br>
            We are the champions<br>
            No time for losers<br>
            'Cause we are the champions of the world<br>
            I've taken my bows<br>
            And my curtain calls<br>
            You brought me fame and fortune<br>
            And everything that goes with it<br>
            I thank you all<br>
            But it's been no bed of roses<br>
            No pleasure cruise<br>
            I consider it a challenge before the whole human race<br>
            And I ain't gonna lose<br>
            And we mean to go on and on and on and on<br>
            We are the champions, my friends<br>
            And we'll keep on fighting till the end<br>
            We are the champions<br>
            We are the champions<br>
            No time for losers<br>
            'Cause we are the champions of the world<br>
            We are the champions, my friends<br>
            And we'll keep on fighting till the end<br>
            We are the champions<br>
            We are the champions<br>
            No time for losers<br>
            'Cause we are the champions<br>
