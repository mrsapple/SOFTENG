                <h2>WHAT CAUSES AIDS?</h2><br>
                <p> AIDS “ Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndroms”  is caused by a virus called HIV (previously called  HTLV – III).</p><br>
                <p>When you catch a virus, the virus make its way  into your blood. Certain white blood cells then produce antibodies which attack and kill the virus. But when the HIV virus gets into the blood, it can actually destroy  those white blood cells, leaving the body wide open to attack from other infections.
                </p><br>
                <p> Anyone  who has the HIV virus could pas the virus on to someone else. They could pass it on either if they have intimate  sexual contact with another person, or if their infected blood  gets into another person's body. </p><br>
                <p>The HIV virus only survives  in body fluids  suchs as blood, semen, saliva and tears. However,  no-one  has caught  AIDS from saliva or  tears. All proven cases have been caused by semen or blood.
                </p><br>
                <p>People  can get the virus: Through  intimate sexual contact, or getting infected blood into their bloodstream. The virus  can be passed  on either in sexual intercourse between homosexuals or in intercourse between a man and a woman.</p><br>

                <h3>TERESINA, PIAUÍ BRAZIL - HISTORY AND NAMES</h3><br>
                <p>Teresina was founded on August 16, 1852 under the name of Vila Nova do Poty (because its origin is linked to the Poti river) as the capital of the state of Piauí. It was the first planned city in the Brazil and the only northeast capital located out of the coast. Until 1852, Oeiras was the capital of the Piauí Capitany, however due to difficulties in communication and trade, the capital was transferred to an area next to the Parnaíba River, to the other cities and to the sea coast.</p><br>
                <p>Colonization of the area where Teresina is now located dates back to the 18th century. The chosen place was a small community of fishermen, in 1760, nearby Poty and Panaíba rivers, which grew into a village called "Vila do Poty", but, due to the inundation of the Parnaíba River riverbanks, the city had to be built in a higher position</p><br>
                <p>  In the 19th century, it was initially called Vila Nova do Poty, but later the city was renamed Teresina, in honor of the Empress Teresa Cristina, the wife of the Emperor of Brazil, Pedro II. 
                </p><br>
                <p>Teresina is the hottest city in the country and the third city with the major incidence of lightning in the world. Nowadays, Teresina's economy is based on international manufacturing industries and trade.</p><br><br>

                <br><h3>What a Wonderful World - Louis Armstrong </h3>
                I see trees of green, red roses too<br>
                I see them bloom for me and you<br>
                And I think to myself, what a wonderful world<br>
                I see skies of blue and clouds of white<br>
                The bright blessed days, the dark sacred night<br>
                And I think to myself, what a wonderful world<br>
                The colors of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky<br>
                Are also on the faces of people going by<br><br>
                I see friends shaking hands, saying: How do you do?<br>
                They're really saying: I love you!<br>
                I hear babies crying, I watch them grow<br>
                They'll learn much more, than I'll never know<br>
                And I think to myself, what a wonderful world<br>
                Yes, I think to myself, what a wonderful world<br>
